## Hi there 
Hi, I'm Samuel Katoh
Web3 Dev Lead | Smart Contract Security | Full-Stack Blockchain
Designing secure protocol architecture and building dApps that don't get rekt
ABOUT ME
Security-first developer — I design access control systems and think about how things break
Currently building a Rug Checker on Monad for token safety analysis
Web3 Dev Lead at CurableLabs — leading smart contract architecture and frontend integration
Fast learner — went from zero to leading protocol design in months
Curious by nature — always digging into how protocols work under the hood
TECH STACK
Smart Contracts: Solidity, Foundry, OpenZeppelin, Hardhat
Frontend & Integration: JavaScript, React, Ethers.js, Web3.js
Blockchain: Ethereum, Monad
FEATURED PROJECTS
Security Architecture | CurableLabs
Multi-tier access control system for decentralized peer review
Role-based permissions: Admin (high-risk) + Scorers (evaluation)
Upgrade path: Solo admin → Multi-sig → DAO governance
OpenZeppelin patterns with reentrancy protection
Led protocol design decisions on security tradeoffs
Tech: Solidity, Foundry, OpenZeppelin, Hardhat
Full-Stack dApp Integration | CurableLabs
Complete frontend integration layer for smart contracts
Web3.js/Ethers.js wallet connection and contract interaction
Real-time blockchain state updates
Transaction handling with comprehensive error management
Responsive UI with security at every layer
Tech: JavaScript, React, Ethers.js, Web3.js
Monad Rug Checker | Personal Project (In Progress)
Security analysis tool for token safety on Monad
Ownership analysis (renounced, hidden owner, reclaimability)
Dangerous function detection (mint, blacklist, pause, proxy)
BubbleMaps integration for holder distribution
Automated safety scoring system
Tech: JavaScript, Node.js, Ethers.js, Monad RPC
Repo: github.com/SJay7/Rug-checker-project
CURRENT FOCUS
Deep-diving into Compound V3, Aave V3, Morpho Blue codebases
Advancing Foundry skills — fuzzing, invariant testing, fork testing
Building security tooling for token analysis
Studying audit methodologies and access control patterns
WHAT I'M GOOD AT
Security Architecture
Access control design
Multi-sig upgrade paths
Trust assumption analysis
Permission boundaries
Frontend Integration
Wallet connectivity
Real-time state management
Transaction UX

PHILOSOPHY
"Security isn't a feature—it's the foundation. If your protocol can be exploited, nothing else matters."
Fun Fact: I design systems by first thinking about how they can be broken. If I can't break it, it might actually be secure.
Open to: DeFi security work, protocol architecture roles, and building things that protect users from getting rugged.
