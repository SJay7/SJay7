## 🚀 About Me

🛡️ **Security-first developer** — I design access control systems and think about how things break

🔧 **Currently building** a Rug Checker on Monad for token safety analysis

💼 **Web3 Dev Lead** at CurableLabs — leading smart contract architecture and frontend integration

⚡ **Fast learner** — went from zero to leading protocol design in months

🔍 **Curious by nature** — always digging into how protocols work under the hood

## 💭 Philosophy

> "Security isn't a feature—it's the foundation. If your protocol can be exploited, nothing else matters."

---

⚡ **Fun Fact:** I design systems by first thinking about how they can be broken. If I can't break it, it might actually be secure.

---

**Open to:** DeFi security work, protocol architecture roles, and building things that protect users from getting rugged.
